# Project - Bank Account System
<p>The Bank Account Management System is a simple console-based application written in C, designed to simulate basic banking operations. It allows users to create an account, log in, transfer money, and view transaction details. The system uses structures like struct data for storing user credentials and struct transaction for managing money transfers. User data such as usernames and passwords are stored in text files (username.txt, password.txt), and transaction records are saved in another file (mon.txt). File I/O operations are used extensively to read and write this data, making the system persistent across sessions.

The application provides a user-friendly interface using functions from the conio.h and windows.h libraries. Functions like gotoxy() help position text on the screen for better visual formatting, while loops and delays are used to simulate processing animations (like account creation and money transfers). During money transfers, the system verifies if the recipient username exists and then records the transfer, though it does not currently check for sufficient balance or authenticate users beyond a basic username-password match.</p>
